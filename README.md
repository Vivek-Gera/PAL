Have you ever know J.A.R.V.I.S..?

J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is a fictional artificial intelligence system created by Tony Stark (Iron Man) in the Marvel Comics and Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). J.A.R.V.I.S. serves as Tony Stark's personal assistant, managing various aspects of his life and providing him with information and analysis.

J.A.R.V.I.S. is known for its advanced capabilities, such as controlling Tony Stark's suits, interfacing with other systems, and providing real-time information and analysis. Over time, J.A.R.V.I.S. evolves and eventually becomes the basis for the creation of Vision, another powerful artificial intelligence entity in the Marvel universe.

It's worth noting that while I'm familiar with J.A.R.V.I.S., I am not directly associated with the Marvel universe and do not possess the same capabilities as the fictional AI.
